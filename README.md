# Notes

## Note 1
    After installing "Material UI [MUI]" (@mui/material) to use list view (<ListItem /> component) & The "styling solution of Material UI [MUI]" (@mui/styles) with npm. 
    I got this problem (Can't resolve "@emotion/react" & "@emotion/styled"), so in order to resolve it I installed them with npm ("npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled").

## Note 2
    In order to use "Enzyme" for the unit test(s), I installed it using this line of command:
        "npm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16"
    But maybe, you can face some problem when using "Enzyme" package, so in order to fix it, I used the
    following line of command: 
        "npm install --save @types/enzyme @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16"
